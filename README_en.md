# ECAD Components Library

[中文](README.md)

For Altium Designer, KiCad...

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive electronic component library designed for ECAD (Electronic Computer-Aided Design) software, including popular platforms like Altium Designer, KiCad, and more.

## Features

- **Extensive Component Coverage:** Our library encompasses a wide range of electronic components, from resistors and capacitors to integrated circuits and connectors. This ensures that you have a diverse selection for your PCB (Printed Circuit Board) designs.

- **Vendor-Agnostic:** Components are organized in a vendor-agnostic manner, providing flexibility in choosing components from various manufacturers based on your project requirements.

- **Footprint Compatibility:** Each component is accompanied by footprint information, ensuring seamless integration into your PCB layout. The footprints are designed to be compatible with leading ECAD software platforms.

- **Regular Updates:** The library is regularly updated to include the latest components and improvements. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to enhance the overall quality and coverage.
